# Data Preprocessing Pipeline
A data preprocessing pipeline is a systematic and automated approach that integrates multiple preprocessing steps into a cohesive workflow. It serves as a guide for data professionals, outlining the necessary transformations and calculations required to clean and prepare data for analysis. Such pipelines are invaluable for data engineers, data analysts, data scientists, and machine learning engineers, as they automate repetitive preprocessing tasks, enabling professionals to focus on higher-value activities and improving overall workflow efficiency.

The pipeline is composed of interconnected steps, each responsible for a specific task, such as:

- **Imputing Missing Values**: Filling in gaps in the data to maintain consistency.
- **Scaling Numeric Features**: Standardizing numerical variables to ensure uniformity across features.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Transforming categorical data into a format suitable for analysis or machine learning models.
- **Detecting and Handling Outliers**: Identifying and addressing anomalies that could skew results.
The pipeline ensures consistency, reproducibility, and efficiency throughout the preprocessing process by adhering to a predefined sequence of operations. The steps above represent fundamental functions that every pipeline should perform when preparing any dataset for analysis or modeling.

I will build a data Preprocessing pipeline using Python based on the fundamental functions every pipeline should perform while preprocessing any dataset.
